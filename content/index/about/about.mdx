import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a mechanical engineer turned full-stack software developer with a passion for taking complex problems and creating innovative applications. I have experience building full-stack applications using React and JavaScript on the front end and .Net for the backend.

My background is in mechanical engineering and robotics. I spent several years designing and programming robotic and automation systems for high tech consumer products. This is where I discovered my passion for programming and spent the majority of my free time becoming a self taught software developer.

As a full-stack developer I enjoy using my passion to build things, attention to detail and design, and the opportunity for lifelong learning to create applications. I'm confident that my design and engineering background and my passion for software development will help me make an impact at a high growth company.
