import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I first learned Java in 2010, at the time I was unaware of software development as a career path and I thought it was a good tool to know about. It wasnâ€™t until I taught myself C++ for robotic applications that I realized my passion for software development. I could spend hours learning about coding and improving my programming skills.

I quickly discovered web development, which provided an outlet to express my creativity through UI design and my problem solving skills through the logic written in JavaScript. I was instantly hooked and spent a majority of my free time becoming a self taught software developer.

My design and engineering background help me to comprehend complex problems and transform them into intuitive applications.
