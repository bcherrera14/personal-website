import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I first learned Java in 2010, at the time I was unaware of software development as a career path and I thought it was a good tool to know about. It wasnâ€™t until I taught myself C++ for robotic applications that I realized my passion for software development. I spent hours learning about coding and improving my programming skills.

I quickly discovered web development, which provided an outlet to express my creativity through UI design and my problem solving skills through the logic written in JavaScript. I was instantly hooked and spent a majority of my free time becoming a self taught software developer.

As a full stack developer I enjoy using my passion to build things, attention to detail and design, and the opportunity for lifelong learning to create intuitive and practical applications. I'm confident that my design and engineering background and my passion for software development will help me make an impact at a high growth company.
